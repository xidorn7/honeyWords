# Course: Privacy and Privacy Concepts in the Wild :
# Assignment #3: Honey word generation based on the top 100 Rock You passwords
# Group:  Suzie-May Ogunseitan, Jillian Sue, Xi Yu, Junbin Sun
#
# 
# Usage: python honey100.py n f1 f2
#        
# where    n = number of passwords desired [optional; default = 19]
#          f1 is the input password files
#          f2 is the name of the desired output file
#       NOTE: The program outputs n passwords per line to match line by line the input password (list)
#
#     Should run OK with python 2.7 (including pypy) and python 3.5
#
# This version of the program does not implement any password-composition restrictions,
# such as a minimum-length on passwords as none were specified in the assignment specifications
#
